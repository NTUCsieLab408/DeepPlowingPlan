## Project Generality
In the multi-core application, we research the anomaly phenomenon on system scheduling.
Design low-level core assigning mechanism to increase convenience and efficient of
multi-core. Moreover, we make a set of high elasticity and efficient batch-pinelining and
 a uniform multi-core scheduling mode to optimize multi-core system efficient.
On the batch-pinelining system we also design a timely fault tolerant mechanism, it can
support single-point failure, and optimize end-to-end delay.

## Future plan
First year: Base on OpenCL design idea, construct mobile device virtual memory transform standard library.

Second year: Construct stock trading cluster environment, and design a library support single-point failure.

Third year: Construct a library which improve the efficience of single-point and end-to-end.

Final: Combine above, and find application on other industry, ex social network credit compute.
